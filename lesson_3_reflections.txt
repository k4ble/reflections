When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you need to share the project with others.  To backup the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So you'll know when a change may have happened if someone else is modifing the files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Probably never because I will probably stick with SVN and just use git to get copies of files when I have to.
