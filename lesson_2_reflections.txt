What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git creates the directory .git containing 3 files and 4 directories.
This must be the structure for the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Not sure since you can remove items.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By staging each change as they are made and tested.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When developing software for processing HL7 messages for multiple clients there is usually a common set of transforms

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The same way a picture helps visualize an object?


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
