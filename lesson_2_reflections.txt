What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git creates the directory .git containing 3 files and 4 directories.
This must be the structure for the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Seems to be an abstract location and the other two are physical.
Not sure since you can remove items.
